# react-native-asset
[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/react-native-asset.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/react-native-asset)[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/unimonkiez/react-native-asset.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/unimonkiez/react-native-asset)

## Link and unlink assets to your react-native project with ease!

## Advantages
* `react-native link` only supports font files, this tool supports all assets.
* Unlinking is automatic when you delete an asset, with `react-native link`, you need to unlink the files manually.
* Proper link (and unlink) for `mp3` (to use with [`react-native-sound`](https://github.com/zmxv/react-native-sound#basic-usage)) and `ttf` files.

## Usage
* Install
  ```bash
  npm install -g react-native-asset
  # or yarn
  yarn global add react-native-asset
  ```
* Add assets to your `react-native.config.js` as you would with `react-native link`
  ```js
  ...
   assets: [
      "./src/font",
      "./src/mp3",
    ];
  ```
* Add platform-specific assets to your `react-native.config.js` like so:
  ```js
  ...
  assets: [
    "./src/mp3",
  ],
  iosAssets: [
    "./src/font/ios",
  ],
  androidAssets: [
    "./src/font/android",
  ],
  ```

* Run the command and linking + unlinking is automatic!
  ```bash
  react-native-asset
  ```
## Explanation
With `react-native link` you have to unlink the files manually, which is hard work.  
Instead this library writes `link-assets-manifest.json` to the root of `android` and `ios` folders to keep track of the files which it added, for later removing it for you if missing from your `assets`!

## Parameters
* `-p, --path` - path to project, defaults to cwd.
* `-a, --assets` - assets paths, for example `react-native-asset -a ./src/font ./src/mp3`.
* `-ios-a, --ios-assets` - ios assets paths, will disable android linking
* `-android-a, --android-assets` - android assets paths, will disable ios linking.
* `-n-u, --no-unlink` - Not to unlink assets which not longer exists, not recommanded.

## Backward compatability
* to use react-native 0.59 and below, use version 1.1.4

## Troubleshooting

### iOS

#### No such file or directory

The asset paths in the Xcode project are not correct. Open the project in Xcode, find the offending resource files in the Project Navigator (they will be red), and manually fix the file locations in the *Identify and Type* panel.

During the asset linking stage on iOS, assets are added to the Xcode project as Resource files who's paths are resolved *Relative to Group* by Xcode. The linker uses the default `Resources` group path when generating the paths for the files relative to the Xcode project. While this works for most standard React Native boilerplate, many projects customize the layout of the groups within their project.
